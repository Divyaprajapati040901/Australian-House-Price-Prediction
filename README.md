# Australian-House-Price-Prediction

🏡 Australian House Price Prediction
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict house prices in Australia based on various features such as location, number of rooms, property type, and more.

📊 Objective
The aim is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates housing prices, helping buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

⚙️ Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized key relationships and outliers in the dataset.

Model Building: Applied multiple regression algorithms including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Model Evaluation: Compared models using RMSE, MAE, and R² scores.

📈 Results
The XGBoost model provided the best accuracy in predicting house prices.
